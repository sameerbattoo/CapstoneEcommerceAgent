How often should I wash the WINTER Jacket?,"[""Q: What's the di�erence between CLO rating and temperature rating?     A: CLO rating measures insulation value (thermal resistance). Temperature rating predicts     comfort at speci�c temps based on CLO value, activity level, and wind conditions.     Q: How often should I wash this jacket?     A: Wash when visibly soiled (typically 1-2 times per season for regular users). Excessive     washing reduces DWR e�ectiveness. Use spot cleaning for minor stains.     Q: Can I machine wash or should I hand wash?     A: Both are acceptable. Hand washing is gentler and recommended for best results. Use     cool water, mild detergent, and avoid fabric softener.     Q: How do I know when to reapply DWR coating?     A: When water stops beading on the outer shell. Typically occurs after 20-30 washes or 1-2     seasons of regular use.     Q: Is this jacket waterproof or water-resistant?     A: Water-resistant. The 5,000mm water column rating handles rain and light snow, but     sustained heavy rain may eventually saturate the fabric. For full waterproo�ng in severe     rain, wear over a rain shell.     10.2 Production Standards     10.3 End-of-Life Options     11.""]","You should wash the winter jacket when it is visibly soiled, which typically occurs 1-2 times per season for regular users.
